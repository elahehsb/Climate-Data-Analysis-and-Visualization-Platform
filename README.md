# Climate-Data-Analysis-and-Visualization-Platform

Overview

This project aims to build a comprehensive climate data analysis and visualization platform. The platform will leverage open-source tools, cloud technologies, and advanced computational methods to handle and process large-scale climate data efficiently. Users will be able to visualize climate trends, run simulations, and predict future climate scenarios.

System Architecture

Components:


Data Ingestion: Tools for acquiring and preprocessing climate data.

Distributed Computing Cluster: Set up with Apache Spark for parallel data processing.

Machine Learning: Implement models for climate trend prediction.

Data Storage: Use Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) for scalable storage.

Web Application: Frontend for data visualization and user interaction.

Deployment: Containerization using Docker and orchestration using Kubernetes.
